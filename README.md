# Comprehensive-SQL-Data-Cleaning-and-Transformation-Project
This project showcases a step-by-step SQL data cleaning workflow, including duplicate removal, data standardization, null value handling, and format normalization. It transforms raw, inconsistent datasets into clean, structured data ready for accurate analysis. Ideal for building strong SQL and data wrangling skills.
This SQL data cleaning project demonstrates a comprehensive and practical approach to transforming raw, inconsistent data into a clean, structured format ready for analysis or reporting. 
The initial step involves creating a staging table from the original dataset to preserve the raw data and create a safe environment for cleaning activities. 
The project then applies essential techniques such as identifying and removing duplicate records using window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), ensuring that only unique records remain while preserving data integrity.
Standardization is key in this project, where inconsistent categorical data—such as variations in industry names or country spellings—are harmonized to maintain uniformity across the dataset.
The process also addresses missing or null values thoughtfully, opting to retain or impute values based on analytical needs, supported by SQL queries that fill gaps using existing information where possible.
Additionally, date fields and textual data are normalized using functions to convert formats and trim unwanted characters. 
The project also involves removing irrelevant or unneeded columns and rows to optimize the dataset for accuracy and performance.
Through this stepwise workflow, the project not only improves data quality but also builds vital SQL skills in writing complex queries that are efficient, maintainable, and transparent.
This hands-on experience is valuable for analysts and data scientists aiming to handle real-world data challenges effectively.
